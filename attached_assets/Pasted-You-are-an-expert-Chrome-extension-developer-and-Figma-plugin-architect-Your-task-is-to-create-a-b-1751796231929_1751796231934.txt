You are an expert Chrome extension developer and Figma plugin architect.

Your task is to create a browser extension/plugin that:

Captures the full visual structure of any live website (HTML, CSS, text, and images)

Parses the DOM into a layer-based structure

Extracts fonts, colors, positions, paddings, margins, z-index, and styles

Downloads or sends this structure as a JSON/Figma-compatible format

Includes actual images used (as base64 or downloadable URLs)

Allows exporting the structure directly into Figma via plugin, Figma REST API, or .fig compatible import

Key Requirements:

The Chrome extension should have:

A popup interface with "Capture Page" and "Export to Figma" buttons

Content script that traverses the DOM, calculates bounding boxes, z-order, text content, images, etc.

Optionally uses html2canvas, dom-to-image, or similar tools

Handles full-page scroll capture or virtual DOM traversal

The Figma export should:

Maintain correct layer order and grouping

Convert HTML tags to Figma equivalents (div â†’ frame, img â†’ image, span/p â†’ text)

Respect exact spacing and layout (grid, flex, absolute, etc.)

Export color styles and text styles

Provide all assets or image data as base64 or downloadable blobs

Final output:

Either a .json file that a companion Figma plugin can import

Or push data directly into a Figma document via REST API (requires OAuth2 token)

Constraints:

Avoid just screenshotting â€” you must preserve editable design structure

Must work client-side (user downloads .json and uploads to Figma themselves)

No cloud backend needed â€” everything runs locally or inside browser

Technologies to use:

Chrome Extensions APIs (MV3)

DOM parsing

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Optional: Figma Plugin API or REST API

ðŸ§ª Optional Extras You Can Add Later:
Detect font families from Google Fonts or inline CSS

Compress images before export

Allow selection of specific parts of the website

Use machine learning to tag components (navbars, hero sections, CTAs)
