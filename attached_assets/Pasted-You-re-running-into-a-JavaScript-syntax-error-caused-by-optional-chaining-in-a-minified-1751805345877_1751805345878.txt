You're running into a JavaScript **syntax error** caused by optional chaining (`?.`) in a **minified file** (`vendor-core-...min.js.br`). The browser is failing to parse this because of one of the following reasons:

---

### 🚨 Problem: `Unexpected token .` from Optional Chaining

Line:

```js
if (element.isFlexContainer && layout?.flexDirection)
```

Error:

```
Unexpected token .
```

---

### 🔍 Root Causes:

1. **Old/Unsupported JavaScript Engine**
   You're likely running this in an environment or browser that **does not support optional chaining (`?.`)** — a feature introduced in modern JS (ES2020+).

2. **Minified Code Issue**
   The error is inside a **`.min.js.br` (Brotli-compressed minified JS)** file — debugging this is painful unless you have the **source code or map files**.

3. **Webpack/Babel Misconfiguration**
   If this is your own codebase, your **Babel config** or **Webpack build** is not transpiling modern JS down to ES5 for browser compatibility.

### ✅ Fixes

#### If You're Using Someone Else's Tool (e.g., "Website to Figma" app):

> You can't fix the internal code unless you're the maintainer. Instead:

* 🔁 **Update your browser** to the latest version (e.g., latest Chrome or Firefox).
* ⚙️ Try a different browser that supports optional chaining.
* 🧪 Check browser console: `navigator.userAgent` and ensure it's not an outdated environment.
* 💬 If it's an extension or app, **report it as a bug** to the developer.

#### If You're Building This App Yourself:

1. ✅ **Update Babel Config** (`.babelrc` or `babel.config.js`):

   ```json
   {
     "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
   }
   ```

2. ✅ **Install Babel Preset**:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
   ```

3. ✅ **Transpile with Optional Chaining Support**:
   Babel will convert:

   ```js
   layout?.flexDirection
   ```

   into:

   ```js
   (layout == null ? void 0 : layout.flexDirection)
   ```

4. ✅ **Ensure your Webpack is calling Babel on `.js` files** (if using Webpack).

### 🧪 Temporary Debug Tip

If you can find the **original unminified file**, open it and replace:

```js
layout?.flexDirection
```

with:

```js
layout && layout.flexDirection
```

But **you cannot do this** if the `.min.js.br` is part of a production bundle that you don’t control.

### TL;DR

* ✅ Update your browser (first thing to try).
* 🛠️ If you're the developer, fix your Babel config to support modern JS features.
* 🤷 If it's someone else's app, report the bug or try it in a different, updated browser.
