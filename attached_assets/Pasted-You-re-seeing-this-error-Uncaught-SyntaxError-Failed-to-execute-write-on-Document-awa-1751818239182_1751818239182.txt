You're seeing this error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules
```

Because you're trying to use `await` **outside an `async` function** and **not in an ES module context**.

### üî• The Problem:

Figma plugin code runs in an `iframe` or `sandbox` environment. If you're injecting code using `document.write()` and that code contains `await` **outside of an `async function` or a `<script type="module">`**, it will throw a syntax error.

In your case, it seems you're doing something like:

```javascript
document.write(`
  <script>
    await someAsyncFunction(); // ‚ùå Invalid here
  </script>
`);
```

### ‚úÖ The Fix:

**Option 1: Wrap `await` inside an `async` function.**

Instead of using `await` at the top level, define and immediately call an async function:

```javascript
document.write(`
  <script>
    (async () => {
      await someAsyncFunction();
    })();
  </script>
`);
```

**Option 2: Use `<script type="module">` (only works if your Figma environment allows it)**

If Figma supports module scripts (rare), you could write:

```javascript
document.write(`
  <script type="module">
    await someAsyncFunction();
  </script>
`);
```

But **most plugin environments (like Figma)** don‚Äôt allow `type="module"` due to CSP (Content Security Policy) restrictions.

### üîß Best Practice for Figma Plugins

Instead of injecting entire script blobs with `document.write`, define your script as a **string or file** and insert it cleanly like this:

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.textContent = `
  (async () => {
    await doSomethingAsync();
  })();
`;
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

### üîç Summary

* You can't use `await` outside an async function or a module script.
* Wrap your logic in an `(async () => { ... })();` IIFE.
* Avoid `document.write()` if you can; it's brittle and outdated for dynamic scripting.

If you show me the exact section of code you're injecting with `document.write`, I‚Äôll rewrite it for you with a safe and clean fix.
