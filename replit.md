# Website to Figma Exporter

## Overview

This is a Figma plugin that captures the visual structure of any live website and converts it into native Figma elements. The plugin uses a Python backend server to fetch and analyze website content, then creates corresponding Figma nodes while preserving the design structure and hierarchy.

## System Architecture

### Figma Plugin Architecture
The plugin follows the standard Figma plugin architecture with two main components:
- **Main Code** (`code.js`): Runs in Figma environment, handles Figma API interactions and node creation
- **UI Interface** (`ui.html`): Plugin interface for URL input and capture control
- **Backend Server** (`server.py`): Python Flask server that fetches and processes website content

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **URL Input**: User enters website URL in plugin interface
2. **Server Request**: Plugin sends URL to Python backend server
3. **Content Fetching**: Server fetches website HTML using requests and BeautifulSoup
4. **DOM Analysis**: Server parses HTML structure and extracts element data
5. **Figma Creation**: Plugin receives structured data and creates native Figma nodes
6. **Layout Application**: Elements are positioned with proper hierarchy and styling

## Key Components

### Content Script (`content.js`)
- **WebsiteCapture Class**: Main capture orchestrator
- Provides visual feedback during capture process
- Handles asynchronous DOM analysis
- Manages capture state and error handling

### Background Service Worker (`background.js`)
- **ExtensionBackground Class**: Core extension management
- Handles installation and setup of default settings
- Routes messages between popup and content script
- Manages context menus and extension lifecycle

### Figma Exporter (`figma-exporter.js`)
- **FigmaExporter Class**: Converts captured data to Figma format
- Creates hierarchical document structure (DOCUMENT → PAGE → FRAME)
- Handles node ID generation and element conversion
- Processes text styles, color styles, and images

### Popup Interface (`popup.html/js/css`)
- **PopupController Class**: Manages user interactions
- Displays capture progress and status updates
- Handles data persistence and export functionality
- Modern gradient UI with responsive design

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User clicks "Capture Page" in popup
2. **Message Passing**: Popup sends capture request to background script
3. **Content Injection**: Background script forwards request to content script
4. **DOM Analysis**: Content script performs comprehensive page analysis
5. **Data Processing**: Figma exporter converts captured data to Figma format
6. **Storage**: Captured data stored in Chrome local storage
7. **Export**: User can download Figma-compatible JSON file
